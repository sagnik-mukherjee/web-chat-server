# web-chat-server
 Implementing a tiny chat/messaging server that works over the HTTP protocol in Java; contains Java binary in the form of class files of an example server and clients in Python3 source code.
 
 Server Terminal: javac Server.java; java Server 3987
 
 Client Terminal: python3 client_test_1.py localhost 3987 user1 pwdA "hello friends, morning"
 
 
 NOTE: web-chat-server/java-chat/login/ should have a blank allCookies.txt file
 
 NOTE: web-chat-server/java-chat/chat/ should have a blank allMessages.txt file
 
 Github did not let me drag and drop /chat and /login unless I removed the blank files.
